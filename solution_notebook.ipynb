    "## Notes\n",
    "For **Question 1.2** for each measurement (m) at a Timestep (t), I considered  the time spent is the time difference between the current timestep (t) and the previous timestep (t-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Question 1.3** a cycle is defined as a progression from a given local minima/maxima to the next immediate local minima/maxima. The size of a cycle is determined by the amplitude of that cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart below represents a 1-minute extract from car 0 signal measurements. A cycle is the distance in y-axis from a local minima (red dot) to a local maxima (green dot).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Question 2** I considered different methodologies such as Dynamic Time Warping,  and Time Series Motifs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to time constraints I chose a methodology I was most familiar with. To programmatically identify the cars that are not behaving properly, I used Anomaly Detection using K-means clustering of Time Series. While in practice this methodology may not be the most robust compared with other more recent options, it successfully works in detecting anomalous vehicles based on the distance from clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm  works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training phase**:\n",
    "- Append together the timeseries data and split into segments of n samples. In this phase, use only data from vehicles that behave correctly. *For the current program I used segment length = 100 and slide length = 10.*\n",
    "- Form a space in n dimensions, with each segment representing one point. \n",
    "- Pass it to a K-means clustering algorithm to determine clustering of segment points and the centroids. Below are some shapes the cluster learned: \n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing phase**:\n",
    "- Pass individual vehicle signal data to the reconstruction algorithm that uses the centroids learned during training. \n",
    "- Poor reconstruction error on any individual segment indicates anomalous shape. *For the current program I determined a threshold of >150 when determining the 98th percentile Reconstruction error. The average error for vehicles properly functioning was of ~105, while those vehicles malfunctioning had an error of ~350. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of timeseries signal data of a vehicle behaving properly. i.e.: `Car_0`\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image0]\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The Autopilot Data Infrastructure team frequently works with timeseries signal data coming from vehicles across our fleet. We  analyze these signals by extracting specific metrics to help us understand how users are interacting with the vehicle. Example metrics include: the most or least common values seen, the most or least time spent at given values, or the largest or smallest deltas seen in the signal.\n",

    "##### For this question, only use data for car_0 - this question should take ~40% of your time\n",
    "To that end, build a module that provides functionality to operate on a timeseries and allows for the following queries: \n",
    " - The top N most/least common values by total occurrence\n",
    " - The top N most/least common values by total time spent\n",
    " - The top N largest/smallest 'cycles' - we will define a cycle as a progression from a given local minima/maxima to the next immediate local minima/maxima. The size of a cycle is determined by the amplitude of that cycle."
